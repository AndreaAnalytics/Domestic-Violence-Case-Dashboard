# Domestic-Violence-Case-Data-Analysis
The **Domestic Violence Case Analysis** wants to analyze patterns in crime categories, particularly focusing on domestic violence cases.

## Dataset used

<a href="https://github.com/AndreaAnalytics/Domestic-Violence-Case-Data-Analysis/blob/main/District_Attorney_Cases_Prosecuted.csv">San Francisco District Attorney Cases<a/>


## Questions (KPIs)

- What is the percentage distribution of each crime category (e.g., Misdemeanors, Felonies, Wobblers) with domestic violence in the dataset?

- What is the amount of cases involving domestic violence, and how does this compare to the total number of cases?

- How do case outcomes differ based on domestic violence status?

## Process

- Refined and tailored the original dataset to isolate key data points that aligned with the projectâ€™s analytical goals, ensuring a focused and relevant analysis.

- Implemented table filters to facilitate quick and seamless navigation through complex data.

- Created structured crime categories (e.g., Wobblers, Misdemeanors, Felonies) to systematically organize and rank crimes based on severity, enabling a more detailed and meaningful analysis.
  
- Conducted a comprehensive calculation of domestic violence cases within each crime category, pinpointing trends and patterns across individual crime types.
  
- Analyzed domestic violence cases by case status (e.g., Pending, Conviction, Dismissal), providing a clear breakdown of outcomes based on domestic violence involvement.
  
- Calculated and compared the total number of crimes against the subset of cases involving domestic violence

- Developed pivot tables according to the questions asked.

- Consolidated all pivot tables into a singular dashboard.
